# Experiment 1 data

This directory contains the raw data files for Experiment 1.

Quanti ran 540 times: 
- for each of the 3 chosen models,
- for both quantized and unquantized versions (2)
- for each workload trace, and we have workloads of 10, 100, 1000 prompts (3)
- for each run (30)
- 3 x 2 x 3 x 30 = 540 runs

Quanti saved in-runs data and summary data showing, especially, the energy consumption.

!IMPORTANT: It seems that some runs were not saved... please check and re-run exp1.sh script for where needed.
