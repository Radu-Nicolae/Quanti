\section{Experiment Execution}\label{sec:experiments}
Report about: how you plan to conduct your experiment, which tools you are going to use, which devices/laptops, figure and description of the overall software/hardware infrastructure you are setting up for the experiment (\eg who communicates with whom, proxies, network requests, order of actions, \etc).
