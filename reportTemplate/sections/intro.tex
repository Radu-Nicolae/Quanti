\section{Introduction}

\textbf{MRQ:} How to explore the impact of compression by quantization of LLMs and how this technique impacts energy consumption, resource utilization, and accuracy?

\textbf{RQ1:} How to design and implement a benchmarking system for quantifying LLMs?

\textbf{RQ2:} How to evaluate the impact of compression by quantization of operational-level metrics of LLMs?

\textbf{RQ3:} How to evaluate the tradeoff accuracy-energy consumption across various-architecture LLMs under quantization and without qunatization?

\textbf{RQ4:} How to evaluate the impact of carbon intensity compressed and uncompressed models at favourable and unfavourable carbon intensity day instances?

Carbon intesity 
- night is the worst
- day is the best



This document represents a template of the final experiment report structure for the course \textit{Green Lab} at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam \cite{greenlab}.

The experiment is conducted according to the guidelines by Wohlin and colleagues \cite{wohlin12, DBLP:books/sp/WohlinRHORW24}.

The total length of this document must not exceed 15 pages, including references, appendixes, \etc

In this section you have to describe 
(i) the domain (\eg mobile apps and their market) and the technologies relevant for understanding the rest of the document, 


(ii) the main motivation behind your experiment (the problem, here you can show examples via apps/tools screenshots, snippets of source code, \etc), 

(iii) what your experiment is about (hint of the solution), and 

(iv) what the developers will learn from the results of your experiment.
